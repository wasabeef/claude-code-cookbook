## Sequential Thinking

Solve complex problems step-by-step through a dynamic, iterative thinking process. This flexible approach allows for course corrections and revisions during the thinking process.

### Usage

```bash
# Request Claude to think sequentially
"Analyze [task] using sequential-thinking"
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Algorithm design
"Design an efficient caching strategy using sequential-thinking"

# Problem solving
"Solve database performance issues using sequential-thinking"

# Design review
"Examine real-time notification system design using sequential-thinking"
```

### Collaboration with Claude

```bash
# Complex implementation strategy
"Examine authentication system implementation strategy using sequential-thinking. Consider OAuth2, JWT, and session management"

# Bug cause analysis
"Analyze memory leak causes using sequential-thinking. Include code review and profiling results"

# Refactoring strategy
cat src/complex_module.js
"Develop a refactoring strategy for this module using sequential-thinking"

# Technology selection
"Analyze front-end framework selection using sequential-thinking. Consider project requirements and constraints"
```

### Thinking Process

1. **Initial Analysis** - Basic understanding and decomposition of the problem
2. **Hypothesis Generation** - Formulate hypotheses for solutions
3. **Verification and Revision** - Verify hypotheses and revise as needed
4. **Branching and Exploration** - Explore multiple solution paths
5. **Integration and Conclusion** - Derive optimal solution

### Features

- **Dynamic Adjustment** - Ability to change direction during thinking
- **Hypothesis Testing** - Cycle of forming and testing hypotheses
- **Branching Thinking** - Simultaneously explore multiple thought paths
- **Gradual Refinement** - Step-by-step refinement of solutions
- **Flexibility** - Policy changes based on new information

### Detailed Examples

```bash
# Complex system design
"Examine e-commerce site microservice design using sequential-thinking. Include order processing, inventory management, and payment integration"

# Security design
"Examine API security design using sequential-thinking. Include authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and audit logging"

# Performance optimization
"Examine large-scale data processing optimization using sequential-thinking. Consider memory usage, processing speed, and scalability"

# Dependency management
"Examine monorepo dependency management strategy using sequential-thinking. Include build time, deployment, and test execution"
```

### Notes

Sequential-thinking is ideal for complex problems that require deepening thought in stages. For simple questions or those with clear answers, use normal question format.

### Execution Example

```bash
# Usage example
"Examine GraphQL schema design using sequential-thinking"

# Expected behavior
# 1. Initial analysis: Analyze basic requirements for GraphQL schema
# 2. Hypothesis generation: Examine multiple design patterns
# 3. Verification: Verify advantages and disadvantages of each pattern
# 4. Branching: Explore new approaches as needed
# 5. Integration: Propose optimal schema design
