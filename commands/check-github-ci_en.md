## GitHub CI Monitoring

Monitors GitHub Actions CI status and tracks until completion.

### Usage

```bash
# Check CI status
gh pr checks
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Check CI after creating PR
gh pr create --title "Add new feature" --body "Description"
gh pr checks
```

### Collaboration with Claude

```bash
# Flow from CI check to correction
gh pr checks
"Analyze CI check results and suggest fixes if there are failures"

# Recheck after correction
git push origin feature-branch
gh pr checks
"Check CI results after correction to confirm no issues"
```

### Example Execution Results

```
All checks were successful
0 cancelled, 0 failing, 8 successful, 3 skipped, and 0 pending checks
