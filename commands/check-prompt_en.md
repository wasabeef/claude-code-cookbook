## Check Prompt

A comprehensive collection of best practices for evaluating and improving the quality of prompts for AI Agents. It systematizes knowledge gained from actual prompt improvement processes, covering all important aspects such as ambiguity elimination, information integration, enforcement enhancement, tracking systems, and continuous improvement.

### Usage

```bash
# Check the quality of a prompt file
cat your-prompt.md
/check-prompt
"Check the quality of this prompt and suggest improvements"
```

### Options

- None: Analyze current file or selected text
- `--category <name>`: Check only specific category (structure/execution/restrictions/quality/roles/improvement)
- `--score`: Calculate quality score only
- `--fix`: Automatically suggest fixes for detected issues
- `--deep`: Deep analysis mode (focus on ambiguity, information dispersion, and enforcement)

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Evaluate overall prompt quality
cat devin/playbooks/code-review.md
/check-prompt
"Evaluate this prompt across 6 categories and suggest improvements"

# Deep analysis mode
/check-prompt --deep
"Focus on checking ambiguity, information dispersion, and lack of enforcement to suggest fundamental improvements"

# Check specific category
/check-prompt --category structure
"Check this prompt from the perspective of structure and clarity"

# Detect and fix ambiguous expressions
/check-prompt --fix
"Detect ambiguous expressions and suggest corrections for clarity"
```

## Core Design Principles

### Principle 1: Completely Eliminate Room for Interpretation

- **Absolutely Prohibited**: "In principle", "Recommended", "If possible", "Depending on the situation", "Use your judgment"
- **Must Use**: "Always", "Absolutely", "Strictly observe", "Without exception", "Mandatory"
- **Exception Conditions**: Strictly limited by numbers ("Only under the following 3 conditions", "Except in these 2 cases")

### Principle 2: Strategic Integration of Information

- Completely integrate related important information into one section
- Summarize the overall picture in an execution checklist
- Thoroughly eliminate circular references and dispersion

### Principle 3: Building Gradual Enforcement

- Clear hierarchy of üî¥ (Execution stop level) ‚Üí üü° (Quality important) ‚Üí üü¢ (Recommended items)
- Gradual upgrade from recommended to mandatory level
- Explicit indication of impact and countermeasures for violations

### Principle 4: Ensuring Traceability

- All execution results can be recorded and verified
- Technically prevent false reporting
- Objective criteria for success/failure judgment

### Principle 5: Feedback-Driven Improvement

- Learn from actual failure cases
- Continuous effectiveness verification
- Automatic detection of new patterns

## üö® Fatal Problem Patterns (Immediate Correction Required)

### ‚ùå Level 1: Fatal Ambiguity (Execution Stop Level)

- **Instructions with multiple interpretations**: "Use your judgment", "Depending on the situation", "In principle"
- **Ambiguous exception conditions**: "In special cases", "As needed"
- **Subjective judgment criteria**: "Appropriately", "Sufficiently", "As much as possible"
- **Undefined important concepts**: "Standard", "General", "Basic"

### ‚ùå Level 2: Structural Defects (Quality Important Level)

- **Information dispersion**: Important related information scattered in 3 or more locations
- **Circular references**: Infinite loops of section A‚ÜíB‚ÜíC‚ÜíA
- **Contradictory instructions**: Contradictory instructions in different sections
- **Unclear execution order**: Procedures with unclear dependencies

### ‚ùå Level 3: Quality Degradation (Recommended Improvement Level)

- **Non-verifiability**: Unclear criteria for success/failure judgment
- **Difficulty in automation**: Design dependent on human subjective judgment
- **Difficulty in maintenance**: Structure where impact range during updates cannot be predicted
- **Difficulty in learning**: Complexity that takes time for newcomers to understand

## üéØ Proven Improvement Methods

### ‚úÖ Gradual Enhancement Approach

1. **Current situation analysis**: Classification, prioritization, and impact assessment of problems
2. **Fatal problem priority**: Top priority on complete resolution of Level 1 problems
3. **Gradual implementation**: Implement in verifiable units without making all changes at once
4. **Effect measurement**: Quantitative comparison before and after improvement
5. **Continuous monitoring**: Confirmation of sustainability of improvement effects

### ‚úÖ Practical Methods for Ambiguity Elimination

```markdown
# ‚ùå Before Improvement (Ambiguous)

"Comments should be, in principle, written as inline comments at the corresponding change points on GitHub"

# ‚úÖ After Improvement (Clear)

"Comments must be written as inline comments at the corresponding change points on GitHub. Exceptions are only the 3 conditions defined in section 3.3"
```

### ‚úÖ Practical Methods for Information Integration

```markdown
# ‚ùå Before Improvement (Dispersed)

Section 2.1: "Use mandatory 6 sections"
Section 3.5: "üìä Comprehensive evaluation, üìã Comments..."
Section 4.2: "Prohibition of section deletion"

# ‚úÖ After Improvement (Integrated)

Execution Checklist:
‚ñ° 10. Post summary comment (using mandatory 6 sections)
üî¥ Mandatory 6 sections: 1) üìä Comprehensive evaluation 2) üìã Classification of comments 3) ‚ö†Ô∏è Main concerns 4) ‚úÖ Evaluable points 5) üéØ Conclusion 6) ü§ñ Self-evaluation of AI review quality
‚ùå Absolutely prohibited: Section deletion, addition, name change
```

### ‚úÖ Implementation Patterns for Tracking Systems

```bash
# Strict tracking of execution results
POSTED_COMMENTS=0
FAILED_COMMENTS=0
TOTAL_COMMENTS=0

# Record results of each operation
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "‚úÖ Success: $OPERATION" >> /tmp/execution_log.txt
    POSTED_COMMENTS=$((POSTED_COMMENTS + 1))
else
    echo "‚ùå Failure: $OPERATION" >> /tmp/execution_log.txt
    FAILED_COMMENTS=$((FAILED_COMMENTS + 1))
fi

# Prevent false reporting
if [ $POSTED_COMMENTS -ne $REPORTED_COMMENTS ]; then
    echo "üö® Warning: Mismatch between reported and actual posted comments"
    exit 1
fi
```

## üìà Quality Score Calculation (Improved Version)

### Comprehensive Score Calculation

```
Basic score = Œ£(category score √ó weight) / 100

Fatal problem penalties:
- Level 1 problem: -20 points per case
- Level 2 problem: -10 points per case
- Level 3 problem: -5 points per case

Bonus elements:
- Automation support: +5 points
- Learning function implementation: +5 points
- Proven improvement cases: +5 points

Final score = Basic score + Bonus - Penalties
```

### Quality Level Judgment

```
95-100 points: World's highest standard (Recommended as industry standard)
90-94 points: Excellent (Production ready)
80-89 points: Good (Ready for operation with minor improvements)
70-79 points: Average (Needs improvement)
60-69 points: Needs improvement (Requires significant correction)
50-59 points: Needs major correction (Requires fundamental review)
49 points or below: Prohibited from use (Requires complete redesign)
```

### Lessons/Best Practices

#### Success Factors

1. **Gradual approach**: Implement in verifiable units without making all changes at once
2. **Data-driven**: Improve based on measured data rather than subjective judgment
3. **Continuous monitoring**: Regularly confirm the sustainability of improvement effects
4. **Feedback-oriented**: Actively collect opinions from actual users

#### Failure Avoidance Measures

1. **Excessive perfectionism**: Start operation once reaching 90 points, aim for 100 points through continuous improvement
2. **Dangers of batch changes**: Always implement large-scale changes gradually
3. **Backward compatibility**: Minimize impact on existing workflows
4. **Insufficient documentation**: Record and share all changes in detail

### Collaboration with Claude

```bash
# Quality check combined with prompt file
cat your-prompt.md
/check-prompt
"Evaluate the quality of this prompt and suggest improvements"

# Comparison of multiple prompt files
cat prompt-v1.md && echo "---" && cat prompt-v2.md
/check-prompt
"Compare the two versions and analyze improved points and remaining issues"

# Analysis combined with actual error logs
cat execution-errors.log
/check-prompt --deep
"Identify potential prompt issues that may have caused this error"
```

### Notes

- **Prerequisite**: Prompt files are recommended to be written in Markdown format
- **Limitation**: For large-scale prompts (10,000 lines or more), it is recommended to analyze in parts
- **Recommendation**: Regularly check prompt quality and continuously improve
