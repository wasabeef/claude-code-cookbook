## PR Feedback

Efficiently handle Pull Request review comments and achieve root cause resolution using a 3-stage error analysis approach.

### Usage

```bash
# Retrieve and analyze review comments
gh pr view --comments
"Classify review comments by priority and create an action plan"

# Detailed analysis of error-related comments
gh pr checks
"Analyze CI errors using a 3-stage approach to identify root causes"

# Quality confirmation after fixes
npm test && npm run lint
"Fixes are complete - please check regression tests and code quality"
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Classify comments
gh pr view 123 --comments | head -20
"Classify review comments into must/imo/nits/q categories and determine response order"

# Collect error information
npm run build 2>&1 | tee error.log
"Identify the root cause of build errors and suggest appropriate fixes"

# Verify fix implementation
git diff HEAD~1
"Evaluate whether this fix appropriately addresses the review comments"
```

### Comment Classification System

```
ðŸ”´ must: Required fixes
â”œâ”€ Security issues
â”œâ”€ Functional bugs
â”œâ”€ Design principle violations
â””â”€ Convention violations

ðŸŸ¡ imo: Improvement suggestions
â”œâ”€ Better implementation methods
â”œâ”€ Performance improvements
â”œâ”€ Readability enhancements
â””â”€ Refactoring proposals

ðŸŸ¢ nits: Minor points
â”œâ”€ Typo fixes
â”œâ”€ Indentation adjustments
â”œâ”€ Comment additions
â””â”€ Naming refinements

ðŸ”µ q: Questions/confirmations
â”œâ”€ Implementation intent verification
â”œâ”€ Specification clarification
â”œâ”€ Design decision background
â””â”€ Alternative solution consideration
```

### 3-Stage Error Analysis Approach

#### Stage 1: Information Collection

**Required actions**
- Full error message capture
- Stack trace review
- Reproduction condition identification

**Recommended actions**
- Environment information collection
- Recent change history
- Related logs review

#### Stage 2: Root Cause Analysis

- 5 Whys analysis application
- Dependency tracking
- Environment difference checking
- Minimal reproduction code creation

#### Stage 3: Solution Implementation

- Immediate response (hotfix)
- Root cause resolution (essential fix)
- Preventive measures (recurrence prevention)

### Response Flow

1. **Comment analysis**: Classification by priority
2. **Fix plan**: Determination of response order
3. **Phased fixes**: Critical â†’ High â†’ Medium â†’ Low
4. **Quality confirmation**: Testing, linting, building
5. **Progress report**: Description of specific fixes

### Post-Fix Verification

```bash
# Basic checks
npm test
npm run lint
npm run build

# Regression tests
npm run test:e2e

# Code quality
npm run test:coverage
```

### Reply Templates

**Fix completion report**

```markdown
@reviewer Thank you for your feedback.
Fixes are complete:

- [Specific fix details]
- [Test results]
- [Verification method]
```

**Technical decision explanation**

```markdown
Implementation background: [Reason]
Considered alternatives: [Options and decision rationale]
Adopted solution benefits: [Advantages]
```

### Notes

- **Priority adherence**: Address in order of Critical â†’ High â†’ Medium â†’ Low
- **Test first**: Confirm regression tests before making fixes
- **Clear reporting**: Describe fix details and verification methods specifically
- **Constructive dialogue**: Polite communication based on technical grounds
