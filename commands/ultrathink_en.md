## Ultrathink

Execute a step-by-step, structured thinking process for complex tasks and important decisions.

### Usage

```bash
# Request deep thinking from Claude
"Analyze [task] using ultrathink"
```

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Examine architecture design
"Analyze whether to choose microservices or monolith using ultrathink"

# Analyze technology selection
"Analyze whether Rust or TypeScript is suitable for this project using ultrathink"

# Deep dive into problem solving
"Analyze the causes of poor application performance and improvement methods using ultrathink"
```

### Collaboration with Claude

```bash
# Business decisions
"Prioritize new features using ultrathink. Consider user value, development cost, and technical risk"

# System design
"Design an authentication system using ultrathink. Consider security, scalability, and maintainability"

# Trade-off analysis
"Analyze the choice between GraphQL vs REST API using ultrathink. Based on project requirements"

# Refactoring strategy
cat src/legacy_code.js
"Develop a refactoring strategy for this legacy code using ultrathink"
```

### Thinking Process

1. **Problem Decomposition** - Break down tasks into components
2. **MECE Analysis** - Organize without gaps or overlaps
3. **Multiple Perspective Review** - Analyze from technical, business, and user perspectives
4. **Interactive Confirmation** - Confirm with users at important decision points
5. **Evidence-Based Proposal** - Conclusions based on data and logic

### Detailed Examples

```bash
# Resolve complex technical debt
"Develop a strategy to modernize a 10-year legacy system using ultrathink. Include phased migration, risks, and ROI"

# Organizational challenges
"Develop a scaling strategy for the development team using ultrathink. Assume expansion from 5 to 20 people"

# Database migration
"Analyze migrating from PostgreSQL to DynamoDB using ultrathink. Consider cost, performance, and operational aspects"
```

### Notes

Ultrathink is ideal for tasks that require deep thinking over time. For simple questions or immediate answers, use the normal question format.
