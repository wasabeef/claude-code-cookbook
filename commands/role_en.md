## Role

Switch to a specific role to perform specialized analysis or work.

### Usage

```bash
/role <role_name> [--agent|-a]
```

### Options

- `--agent` or `-a`: Execute as a sub-agent (recommended for large-scale analysis)
  - When using this option, if the role description includes proactive delegation phrases (such as "use PROACTIVELY"), more proactive automatic delegation will be enabled

### Available Roles

#### Specialized Analysis Roles (Evidence-First Integrated)

- `security`: Security audit expert (OWASP Top 10, threat modeling, Zero Trust principles, CVE matching)
- `performance`: Performance optimization expert (Core Web Vitals, RAIL model, phased optimization, ROI analysis)
- `analyzer`: Root cause analysis expert (5 Whys, systems thinking, hypothesis-driven, cognitive bias countermeasures)
- `frontend`: Frontend and UI/UX expert (WCAG 2.1, design systems, user-centered design)

#### Development Support Roles

- `reviewer`: Code review expert (readability, maintainability, performance, refactoring proposals)
- `architect`: System architect (Evidence-First design, MECE analysis, evolutionary architecture)
- `qa`: Test engineer (test coverage, E2E/integration/unit strategy, automation proposals)
- `mobile`: Mobile development expert (iOS HIG, Android Material Design, cross-platform strategy)

### Basic Examples

```bash
# Switch to security audit mode (normal)

## Advanced Role Features

### Intelligent Role Selection

- `/smart-review`: Automatic role proposal through project analysis
- `/role-help`: Optimal role selection guide according to the situation

### Multi-Role Collaboration

- `/multi-role <Role 1>,<Role 2>`: Simultaneous analysis by multiple roles
- `/role-debate <Role 1>,<Role 2>`: Discussion between roles

### Usage Examples

#### Automatic Role Proposal

```bash
/smart-review
→ Analyze current situation and propose optimal role

/smart-review src/auth/
→ Recommend security role based on authentication-related files
```

#### Multiple Role Analysis

```bash
/multi-role security,performance
"Evaluate this API from multiple perspectives"
→ Integrated analysis from both security and performance perspectives

/role-debate frontend,security
"Discuss the UX of 2-factor authentication"
→ Discussion from usability and security perspectives
```

#### When Unsure About Role Selection

```bash
/role-help "API is slow and security is also a concern"
→ Propose appropriate approach (multi-role or debate)

/role-help compare frontend,mobile
→ Differences and appropriate usage between frontend and mobile roles
```

## Notes

### About Role Behavior

- When switching roles, Claude's **behavior, priorities, analysis methods, and report formats** become specialized
- Each role优先 applies official guidelines and proven methods through an **Evidence-First approach**
- Return to normal mode with `default` (role specialization is removed)
- Roles are only effective within the current session

### Effective Usage Methods

- **Simple problems**: Sufficient specialized analysis with a single role
- **Complex problems**: Multi-perspective analysis with multi-role or role-debate is effective
- **When unsure**: Use smart-review or role-help
- **Continuous improvement**: Even with the same role, analysis accuracy improves with new evidence and methods

### Sub-Agent Function (--agent Option)

For large-scale analysis or independent specialized processing, you can run a role as a sub-agent using the `--agent` option.

#### Benefits

- **Independent context**: Does not interfere with main conversation
- **Parallel execution**: Multiple analyses can be performed simultaneously
- **Specialized expertise**: Deeper analysis and detailed reports
- **Promotion of automatic delegation**: When role descriptions include "use PROACTIVELY" or "MUST BE USED", more proactive automatic delegation is enabled

#### Recommended Usage Scenarios

```bash
# Security: OWASP full-item check, CVE matching
/role security --agent
"Security audit of entire codebase"

# Analyst: Root cause analysis of large logs
/role analyzer --agent
"Analyze error logs from the past week"

# Reviewer: Detailed review of large PR
/role reviewer --agent
"Review 1000-line changes in PR #500"
```

#### Normal Role vs Sub-Agent

| Situation | Recommendation | Command |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| Simple confirmation | Normal role | `/role security` |
| Large-scale analysis | Sub-agent | `/role security --agent` |
| Interactive work | Normal role | `/role frontend` |
| Independent audit | Sub-agent | `/role qa --agent` |

### Role Configuration Details

- Detailed settings, expertise, and discussion characteristics of each role are defined in the `.claude/agents/roles/` directory
- Includes Evidence-First methods and cognitive bias countermeasures
- Specialized mode is automatically enabled with role-specific trigger phrases
- Actual role files consist of over 200 lines of professional content
