## Frequently Asked Questions

## Q: What's the difference between frontend and mobile roles?

```text
A:
frontend: Web browser-focused, HTML/CSS/JavaScript
mobile: Mobile app-focused, iOS/Android native, React Native, etc.

For issues related to both, multi-role frontend,mobile is recommended
```

## Q: How to choose between security and analyzer roles?

```text
A:
security: Prevention of attacks and threats, security design
analyzer: Analysis of causes of existing problems, investigation

For security incident investigations, use multi-role security,analyzer
```

## Q: What's the difference between architect and performance roles?

```text
A:
architect: Long-term design of entire systems, scalability
performance: Specific speed and efficiency improvements

For performance design of large-scale systems, use multi-role architect,performance
```

## Collaboration with Claude

```bash
# Combined with situation description
/role-help
"React app page loading is slow, receiving complaints from users"

# Combined with file content
cat problem-description.md
/role-help
"Recommend the most suitable role for this problem"

# When unsure between specific options
/role-help compare security,performance
"Which role is appropriate for JWT token expiration issues?"
```

## Notes

- For complex problems, combining multiple roles is more effective
- For urgent matters, use single role for quick response
- When unsure, it's recommended to use smart-review for automatic proposals
- The final decision should be made by the user considering the nature of the problem
